# Hands-On-ML-Journey
My ML Journey from following along ML projects to actually understanding the behind the scenes.

# Learning ML (The Hard Way)

I've already built some projects like Diabetes Predictor, Sales Predictor and some more by following tutorials and using Colab. **The truth?** Sometimes I was just copying code without fully getting *why* it worked.

So to fix this I’m using Aurélien Géron's book to just stop "following along" and start "knowing." This repo is my brain dump.

### What’s happening here:
- **Notebooks:** My messy attempts at the book's exercises.
- **Notes:** Explanations for my future self so I don't forget.
- **Mistakes:** A list of things I broke and (hopefully) fixed.

### The Goal:
Just get through the book, one chapter at a time, and get better at Python and ML logic.
