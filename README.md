# Hands-On-ML-Journey
My ML Journey from following along ML projects to actually understanding the behind the scenes.

# Learning ML (The Hard Way)

I've already built some projects like Diabetes Predictor, Sales Predictor and some more by following tutorials and using Colab. **The truth?** Sometimes I was just copying code without fully getting *why* it worked.

So to fix this I’m using Aurélien Géron's book to just stop "following along" and start "knowing." This repo is my brain dump.

# Learning Roadmap
Chapter      Project / Topic          Status             Key Mastery
01           The ML Landscape         ✅ Complete      "Overfitting vs. Underfitting, Model Selection"
02           California Housing       🚀 In-Progress   "Pipelines, Stratified Sampling, Custom Transformers, Cross-Validation"

### What’s happening here:
- **Notebooks:** My messy attempts at the book's exercises.
- **Notes:** Explanations for my future self so I don't forget.
- **Mistakes:** A list of things I broke and (hopefully) fixed.

### The Goal:
Just get through the book, one chapter at a time, and get better at Python and ML logic.

# My Learn Log
Jan 01 2026: Chapter-02 lessons
1. This chapter made me realize the actual importance of data preprocessing and that I will maximum time doing it in a project.
2. The importance of Stratified Sampling and how it averts sampling bias, keeping the distribution even.
3. It took me a while to understand the data pipline and Custom Transformer part.

*If you're also learning this, feel free to point out if I'm doing something wrong!*

**How to use:** Since I'm learning on the go, I use Google Colab. Just click the "Open in Colab" button in the notebooks to run the code without installing anything!
